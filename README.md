- `xcode-select --install`
- `python -V`
  - Your Terminal should say something like "Python 2.7.13". Your last two digits might be different, that's okay. If you get something that Python 3, which looks like: "Python 3.X.XX" let Sisi know.
- `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python`
